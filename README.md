How to run:

first time: (setup) 
Remove out\build folder if it exists. (first use)
sh configure.sh (in bash)

Run:
sh brun.sh

Note this builds and runs the program, the program itself i.e the exe file lies in the folder out\build by the name problems.exe
So all the output\input files would be located there.

If you put files in assets\files then it would be automatically copied to the output destination, after running configure.sh.
